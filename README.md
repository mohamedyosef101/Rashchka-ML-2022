# Implementing ML with PyTorch & Scikit-Learn 
This is me trying to implement the algorithms in this amazing book by Sebastian Raschka in MY101 way. (I will add more about my code style and choices later)

## About the book
Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn is a comprehensive guide to machine learning and deep learning with PyTorch. It acts as both a step-by-step tutorial and a reference you'll keep coming back to as you build your machine learning systems. Packed with clear explanations, visualizations, and examples, the book covers all the essential machine learning techniques in depth. While some books teach you only to follow instructions, with this machine learning book, we teach the principles allowing you to build models and applications for yourself.
